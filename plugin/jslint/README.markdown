jslint.vim
=============

Vim plugin and command line tool for running JSLint <http://jslint.com/>.

JSLint is a handy tool that spots errors and common mistakes in
JavaScript code.

This is alpha software and is under heavy development.


Installation and Use
-----------------------

- Make sure you have a JavaScript interpreter installed. In Ubuntu you can
  install the Spidermonkey shell with this command:

        $ sudo apt-get install spidermonkey-bin

  On Windows you can use `cscript.exe` - which is probably already installed.

- If you have rake installed, run:

        $ rake install

  Otherwise copy the directory plugin/jslint/ into your Vim plugin directory.
  Usually this is `~/.vim/plugin/`. On Windows it is `~/vimfiles/plugin/`.

- Simple mode:

    *   Open a JavaScript file in Vim and run the command `:JSLintLight` to
        check the file. If there are potential errors they will be highlighted
        in red.  If there is an error on the line under the cursor an
        explanation of that error will be printed at the bottom of the screen.

        Run `:JSLintLight` again once the errors are fixed to remove error
        highlighting.

- Quickfix mode:

    *   Open a JavaScript file in Vim and run the command `:JSLint` to check
        the file. If there are potential errors they will be highlighted in red
        and the quickfix window will open.

        Run `:JSLint` again once the errors are fixed to remove error
        highlighting and to close the quickfix window.

- (optional) Add configuration to your `~/.vimrc` file to bind JSLint to a key.
  For example:

        " Run JSLint on the current file in simple mode when <F4> is pressed.
        map <F4> :JSLintLight<CR>

        " Run JSLint on the current file with quickfix when <F5> is pressed.
        map <F5> :JSLint<CR>

To get a detailed report of any issues in your JavaScript file outside of Vim,
run the `bin/jslint` executable in a terminal. For example:

      $ bin/jslint plugin/jslint/fulljslint.js

You can copy `bin/jslint` into for `PATH` for easier access. The executable
requires that the Vim plugin is installed and also requires Ruby.


Working with quickfix
-----------------------

The quickfix window will display a list of all potential errors in the file
with an explanation for each. Running `:JSLint` will automatically open the
quickfix window if there are potential errors and will close it if no problems
are detected.

Note that the quickfix list will be cleared and regenerated every time you run
`:JSLint`.

Here are some quick notes for using quickfix:

- In the quickfix window, moving your cursor over an item and pressing enter
  will jump the cursor to that line in your file.

- In either your file or the quickfix window `:cn` will jump the cursor to the
  next potential error, and `:cp` will jump the cursor to the previous item.

- Open and close the quickfix window with `:copen[n]` and `:ccl[ose]`.

You can find more detailed documentation in the [Vim Reference Manual][quickfix
manual].
